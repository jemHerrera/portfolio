                                        <h3>About Scriddish</h3>
                                        <p>If you much prefer to cook meals at home, then you must understand my struggles. Cooking at home on a consistent basis is a lot harder than it sounds. It requires tremendous amount of dedication, planning and mental effort. This is why most prefer eating out or ordering food online. Here is an example of my usual grocery shopping routine:</p>
                                        <p><i class="color-gray3 font-weight-300">First I have to decide which set of meals to cook for the next few days. This means I have to spend time researching recipes online or remembering recipes that I already know. The next step is to list down ingredients for grocery shopping, but I have to make sure not to add ingredients that already exist in the pantry. I also need to make sure that my grocery list is sorted by meats, produce, condiments, sauces, etc. so I don’t have to waste time going back and forth between different sections and aisles in the grocery store.</i></p>
                                        <p>I had to keep on repeating these tasks almost twice a week and I find it quite time consuming. So it made me think, Why not build a tool that can ease up or automate some of these repetitive tasks for the sake of my inner peace? And thus Scriddish was born..</p>
                                        <p><span class="color-red">Scriddish</span> is one of my personal projects, a Single Page Application that I built to help me with my meal planning struggles. I have no idea why I called it Scriddish, but atleast it’s not generic such as “Meal Planner Mock Application”.</span></p>

                                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                        <p>Probably the biggest challenge for this project is planning the code architecture. Starting to code from scratch is exciting because there are endless ways to build, but at the same time it can also be quite overwhelming. I had to consider possible features and edge cases on the planning phase to avoid hitting major development walls.</p>
                                        <p>Aside from building the project itself, my secondary goal is to use this project as an opportunity to practice and learn Vue3’s new Composition API. While learning as I go, I had to experiment on finding better ways to structure my components. It also involves setting up navigation between components and modals and as well as figuring out how to structure recipe data in a way that it’s easy to keep adding more in the future.</p>

                                        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                                        <p>For the next phase of the project, I am planning to include user features, where accounts can be created. Each individual account can contribute by creating their own recipes, which they can set as private or public, much like github but for recipes. For this I have to learn how to set up a database, as well as learn back-end software development.</p>

                                        <p>The most essential feature of this website is its ordering system for prescription lenses. Prescription lenses are not structured similarly as the typical e-commerce items such as clothing where each item has only a few varieties of color and size. Prescription lenses are much more complex, where each product is a combination of different kinds of lens type, lens thickness, lens coating, and each has its own range of sphere power and cylinder power. The client wanted to build the prescription selections in a two dimensional grid format, where the Y-axis corresponds to the Sphere power of the lens, while the X-axis corresponds to the Cylinder.</p>

                                        <p>Having this position as my first ever developer job without any Senior to teach me the ropes, I had to learn everything on my own while staying as productive as possible. Most of the time when I don’t have a solid solution to a problem right away, I had to map out all the possible solutions, explore them one by one, and find the best solution out of them. Although this approach takes a lot of time, this process helped me a lot in improving my problem solving skills. </p>

                                        <p>From this project I have learned the ins and outs of Shopify APIs, as well as how to use a combination of VueJs and Liquid(Shopify’s templating language) to effectively display 10k+ different combinations of lens products in a single web page without affecting the loading times.</p>
                                        <p>From this project I also improved my design and UX skills. On top of the development tasks it was also my job to build a dashboard style user interface with a focus on usability, simplicity and aesthetics.</p>

                                        <p><span class="color-red">Sense of Neumor</span> is a simple but fun project. The objective is to feature a new kind of UI style called neumorphism, which is associated with a more realistic shadow effect. Applying neumorphic style to a UI element often involves not just a shadow on one side, but also a highlight on the opposite side. For this to work the background color must be slightly darker than white(#FFF). This creates a realistic 3D effect where a light source is more apparent.</span></p>

The process is about calculating the coordinates of the light source element relative to the subject, computing the angle, then converting the values into css box-shadow syntax.</p>

                                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                        <p>One of the biggest technical challenges that I encountered in building Eye Hub Warehouse is the prescription system. Aside from the wide variety of lenses, what adds to the complexity is that customers have to input their prescription values. Based on the strength of their prescription, only a certain lens products are available. This means that every lens product must have their own “prescription range” associated with them. And the same goes for the glasses. Depending on the dimensions and sizes of the frame, only a certain strength of prescription is available. Working on this problem helped me learn and understand data structure and data manipulation.</p>

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>The majority of my work experience come from Eylence Group, an eyewear conglomerate. After self-studying for 6 months back in 2018, I was hired as their web developer to work alongside with a marketing manager and a graphic designer. Our task is to build Shopify e-commerce stores with the focus on lead-generation and sales. My responsibility is to be in charge of the whole dev process. It was a perfect opportunity for me to learn and grow as a Junior developer.</p>
                        <p>One of the challenges that I encountered in this experience is the absense of a senior developer to teach me the ropes, or another developer to brainstorm and compare work with. Although this gives me a lot of freedom to be creative, I had to be careful to get the habit of keeping my code as clean and as maintainable as possible. I needed to keep the balance between learning and production, as well as keep up with the updates in technologies and modern coding techniques. From the experience I became accustomed to using Shopify API, mainly manipulating product data and presenting them in the front-end in various creative ways.</p>
                        <p>I currently work as a freelance dev for the same company, but is also looking for full-time opportunities. Since all the years of my experience I’ve only worked as the lone developer, I also would love to experience working with other developers to further grow my technical and communication skills. Despite the experience I consider myself still a beginner in the field, as there’s so much more to grasp and be proficient with.</p>

                    <div id="story-skills" class="story">
                        <h3>Skills</h3>
                        <p>My technical skills lie in UI/UX design, front-end implementation and Shopify Theme Development. My prototyping software of choice is Figma, while my front-end framework of choice is Vue (I know I should start learning React). I’m a SOLID Design principle practitioner, slowly but surely making sure to improve on the way I keep my code readable, maintainable and expandable.</p>

                        <h3>Outide Dev</h3>
                        <p>Outside work I consider myself to be a lifetime learner who likes to improve and optimize. On my free time I love creating digital art, studying philosophy, working out, doing yoga and creating weird front-end projects. I also recently started doing Jiu Jitsu, and I love how there’s a huge world of techniques within it, endless possibilities of combinations of moves for me to uncover. I wish there’s more time for me to do all these activities. If you are interested in my digital art works, you can check them out on Instagram.</p>

<!-- to do
1. href on projects so back button works
2. nav and rainbow strip disappears while project is active. create a head container that is sticky.
3. Mobile
4. github
5. proofread
